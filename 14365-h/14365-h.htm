    <p>The last play by M. BLAGUE VAN DER BOSCH has just been
    translated into English. It is called <i>The Blackbeetle</i>,
    and is a purely domestic drama. The following Scene from the
    last Act will give some idea of the exquisite simplicity and
    pathos of this great work. M. VAN DER BOSCH's admirers freely
    assert that SHAKSPEARE never wrote anything like this. It will
    be noticed that M. VAN DER BOSCH, like M. MAETERLINCK, does not
    always name his characters, but only mentions their relation to
    each other.</p>

    <p>Everybody who took delight in our old friend <i>Uncle
    Remus</i> will thoroughly enjoy <i>A Plantation Printer</i>, by
    JOEL CHANDLER HARRIS. The Baron doesn't recommend it to be
    taken at one sitting, the dialect being rather difficult, but a
    chapter at a time will be found refreshing. The like advice may
    be acted upon by anyone who has invested in the latest volume
    of the Library of Wit and Humour, entitled <i>Faces and
    Places</i>. By H.W. LUCY. The "Faces" are represented by a
    portrait of Ride-to-Khiva BURNABY, and one of the Author of
    these entertaining papers. The first brief narrative, which
    ought to have been called "How I met BURNABY," is specially
    interesting; and the only disappointing thing in the book is
    the omission of "An Evening with Witches," as a companion
    picture to "A Night at Watts's."</p>

    <p>By the way, in my copy of <i>A Plantation Printer</i>, the
    English printer has made one slip, a sin of omission, at p.
    153, where, Miss CARTER, a charming young lady, is watching a
    Georgian Fox-hunt. She sees "a group of shadows, with musical
    voices, sweep across the Bermuda fields."</p>

    <p>"'O ow beautiful!' exclaimed Miss CARTER, clapping her
    little hands," and, we may add, dropping her little "h" in her
    excitement. "I can put up with the loss of an 'h,' but not for
    a wilderness of aspirates would I have lost this healthy,
    cheery chapter," says</p>

    <h2>RICH V. POOR.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>A Note kindly contributed by Our Own Graphic
    Reporter.</i>)</h4>

    <p>Nothing could have been more impressive than the closing
    scene of a trial that was one of the features of the present
    Sessions. The Counsel for the Prisoner made no pretence of
    hiding his emotion, and freely used his pocket-handkerchief.
    Many ladies who had until now been occupied in using
    opera-glasses, at this point relinquished those assistants to
    the eyesight, to fall back upon the restorative properties of
    bottles filled with smelling-salts. Even his Lordship on the
    Bench was seemingly touched to the very quick by the Prisoner's
    dignified appeal for mercy. Before passing sentence, the Judge
    glanced for a moment at the number of titled and other highly
    respectable witnesses who had testified to the integrity of the
    accused. Then he addressed the Prisoner:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"You have pleaded guilty to an indictment which charges you
    with having misappropriated trust moneys. You have reduced a
    fortune of £28,000 to £7,000. This means a wretched pittance to
    beneficiaries who, before your fraud, were enjoying a fairly
    decent income. I am aware that you are a distinguished
    Magistrate,&mdash;that you have belonged to many
    Clubs,&mdash;that there is not a slur upon the cooking that
    used to distinguish your dinner-parties. I know the severity of
    the sentence I am about to pass, and I wish my conscience would
    permit me to give you a lighter punishment. But I cannot."</p>

    <p>The accused was then sentenced to five years' penal
    servitude.</p>

    <p>A little later another prisoner was put in the dock for
    stealing twenty shillings. The prisoner (who was a sailor) was
    sentenced to ten years' penal servitude, and seven years'
    police supervision. The case was of no public interest.</p>

    <h2>THE FORCE OF EXAMPLE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>A Story of Adventure not in the least Likely to be
    True.</i>)</h4>

    <p>"Do you see what RITCHIE has been doing?" asked the
    Secretary of State for War of one of his colleagues.</p>

    <p>"If you mean visiting the Casual Wards, after attending a
    meeting in the East End of London, I do," replied the
    Home-Secretary. "An excellent idea, no doubt, suggested by that
    old story of the Amateur Casual, which appeared some twenty or
    thirty years ago in the columns of an evening paper."</p>

    <p>"But don't you think it is playing it a little low?"
    suggested the First Lord of the Admiralty.</p>

    <p>"Well, I don't know," returned the Autocrat of the W.O.
    "After all, there is nothing like personal experience."</p>

    <p>And then all three were silent, lost in profound
    consideration. Shortly afterwards they bade one another adieu,
    declaring that they had greatly enjoyed their Cabinet
    Council.</p>

    <p>It was some hours later that a soldier, wearing the uniform
    of the Guards, appeared at the Wellington Barracks, and
    requested that he might be permitted to undertake a spell of
    "sentry go." He was not known by the Non-commissioned Officer
    on duty, but as his papers appeared to be correct, permission
    was given him to act as substitute for Private SMITH, who was
    next on the roster.</p>

    <p>And about the same time a person, wearing the garb of a
    convict, made his way to one of Her Majesty's Prisons, and
    requested an interview with the Governor. His garb obtained for
    him immediate admission to the precincts of the gaol.</p>

    <p>"Well, my man," said the Governor, when his visitor appeared
    before him; "what do you want?"</p>

    <p>"If you please, Sir," replied the person in the garb of a
    convict, "I shall be very much obliged if you will permit me to
    have an hour or so at oakum-picking."</p>

    <p>"Absolutely impossible," replied the Crown Official, "such
    luxuries are only allowed to individuals who have been properly
    introduced to us by a Judge and Jury."</p>

    <p>"I fancied," returned the wearer of the felon's garb, "that
    an order from the Home-Secretary would smooth all
    difficulties."</p>

    <p>"Certainly," admitted the Governor, "but such documents are
    only supplied to European Royal Personages, or other foreigners
    of extreme distinction."</p>

    <p>"I have the requisite document," replied the
    curiously-garbed stranger, and he was bowed into a
    well-appointed cell, and furnished with the tangled rope for
    which he had petitioned.</p>

    <p>And about the same time a sea-faring man applied to be rated
    on one of Her Majesty's Ships of War.</p>

    <p>"Impossible!" was the immediate reply of the Captain, who
    was rather short-tempered.</p>

    <p>"Nothing is impossible to the Admiralty," said the
    sea-faring man; "and, if you will glance at this paper, you
    will see that I have special permission from Whitehall to be
    mast-headed, or to undertake some other naval manoeuvre of a
    more modern date."</p>

    <p>Suppressing an exclamation of a somewhat profane character,
    the Captain gave the required permission, and a few minutes
    later the sea-faring man was mounting (with some difficulty),
    the quivering rungs of a rope-ladder.</p>

    <p>A few hours after the happening of these events, a weary
    soldier, a half-starved convict, and a sailor covered with
    bruises, met by chance in the common room of a tavern. For some
    minutes they were too exhausted to speak. At length, the
    convict declared that the organisation of Her Majesty's Prisons
    was simply perfect.</p>

    <p>"I greatly doubt it," replied the soldier; "but I can insist
    with truth, that nothing can possibly equal the admirable
    condition of the Queen's Barracks."</p>

    <p>"I don't for a moment believe it," put in the sea-faring
    man; "but I am prepared to swear that the arrangements of the
    Admiralty could not possibly be better."</p>

    <p>"Very likely," sneered the convict; "and no doubt they could
    not be worse!"</p>

    <p>Upon this the three men began quarrelling and boasting of
    the merits of the institutions they had recently visited.</p>

    <p>"Pardon me," at length observed the convict, "but I have had
    some legal training, and it seems to me that you are both
    gentlemen of great discernment. Nay, more, I should imagine
    that your education is greatly in excess of that possessed by
    men of the same standing in the professions you appear to have
    adopted."</p>

    <p>"Not unlikely," replied the soldier, smilingly removing his
    disguise; "because I happen to be the Secretary of State for
    War."</p>

    <p>"And I," said the sailor, following suit, and emerging from
    his sea-faring garb, which now was found to be covering an
    official uniform&mdash;"And I am the First Lord of the
    Admiralty."</p>

    <p>Before the two Ministers could recover from their surprise,
    the wearer of the convict's garb had also divested himself of a
    part of his costume, and the whole of his "make-up."</p>

    <p>"You see you need not be ashamed of my company," he
    observed, with a smile, "as I am the Home-Secretary."</p>

    <p>Then the three Ministers laughed, and each one of them
    insisted that his particular branch of the Government Service
    was better than the branches of his colleagues.</p>

    <p>"Let us change costumes," suggested the Home-Secretary, "and
    try for ourselves. I will become a soldier, you can appear as a
    convict, and subsequently we might make a further alteration,
    and allow our friend of the Admiralty to try some
    oakum-picking." But both the First Lord and the Secretary of
    State raised objections.</p>

    <p>"And yet," urged the Home-Secretary, "I do not think you
    would find much difference between oakum-picking and sentry-go,
    and a plank-bed and a hammock on board a torpedo-boat have each
    great claim to points of similarity."</p>

    <p>"We readily believe you," replied the representative of the
    War Office, "and therefore further test is unnecessary."</p>

    <p>"Quite so," added the greatest living authority on Naval
    matters; "and thus I think we can conveniently leave further
    personal investigation to such enthusiasts as Mr. RITCHIE and
    his Private Secretary." And so, perfectly satisfied with the
    result of their peregrinations, the Ministers again bade one
    another adieu, and, this time, finally separated.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. P.</i> Well, yes, in the sense of being discarded.
    They are neither satisfactory, although they contradict one
    another.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. B.</i> So I think, <i>Mr. Punch</i>. What is to be
    done?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. P.</i> I will do my best to answer you. But just as a
    preliminary question, may I ask whether you insure your house,
    Mr. BULL?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. B.</i> Why, yes, certainly. I pay for guardianship
    and protection. If I did not, I should have to start
    fire-engines and the rest of it myself.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. P.</i> Quite so. And you find it cheaper in the long
    run.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. B.</i> To be sure. I have got much, too much to do to
    bother about the details of security from fire.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. P.</i> Again quite so. Then why don't you pay for
    your Army?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. B.</i> But I do, and a precious round sum too!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. P.</i> However, it is difficult to get recruits. And
    in England any and everything can be bought by money.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. B.</i> Pardon me, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, that's all
    nonsense. Abroad, they can get soldiers at half the price
    that&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Mr. P.</i> (<i>interrupting</i>). Quite wrong, Mr. BULL.
    Soldiers are just as dear on the Continent as they are here.
    Only, you see, the foreigners look after the fire
    themselves&mdash;they become soldiers, instead of securing
    substitutes.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. B.</i> What do you mean?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. P.</i> That you must either pay the market price, or
    go in for conscription. Your money&mdash;or your life!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. B.</i> Well, I really think I must consider
    it&mdash;I do, indeed!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. P.</i> And the sooner the better, Mr. BULL; and if
    you do not believe me, give Lord WANTAGE's Committee Report a
    second reading.</p>

    <h2>CONFESSIONS OF A DUFFER.</h2>

    <h3>VI.&mdash;THE DUFFER AT WHIST.</h3>

    <h4>(<i>Continued.</i>)</h4>

    <p>I am really fond of the game, which is fortunate, though my
    partners don't think so; but I am free to confess, that nothing
    short of an absorbing admiration for it and desire to excel,
    could tempt me to brave the sarcasms, even insults, to which I
    am subjected. Your thoroughgoing Whist-player as
    such&mdash;admirable in private life as I personally know him
    to be&mdash;the moment he begins the daily business of his
    life, seems to cast his better nature to the winds. At another
    time and place he would lend a sympathetic ear to any tale of
    woe; now and here nothing seems to interest him but his own
    immediate welfare, which he pursues with concentrated energy
    and earnestness. I verily believe that if, at one of two
    adjoining tables, the chandelier fell on the players' heads to
    their exceeding detriment, the occupants of the other table
    would scarcely lift their eyes or interrupt their rubber for
    one moment. <i>Fiant chartæ ruat coelum</i>&mdash;let the cards
    be made whatever chandeliers fall.</p>

    </div>

    <p>The players at my Club are all good, one especially so, a
    retired Colonel of a West Indian regiment, of whom I stand in
    mortal dread. He has short shrift for any failings, even of
    players nearly as good as himself, whilst as for me! though he
    has never yet resorted to personal violence with a chair-leg,
    yet that would not surprise me; and my pestilent fate in
    defiance of all mathematical odds in such case made and
    provided, is to cut him as my partner three and four times in
    succession in an evening. I sometimes have glimmerings of
    sense, and in hands presenting no particular difficulty, if
    they contain plenty of good cards&mdash;can manage to scrape
    along in a way I think fairly satisfactory even&mdash;to him,
    though he never encourages me by saying so. But an awful thing
    happened the other night. I had played one rubber with him and
    won it, though it was only a rubber of two instead of a bumper,
    as it would have been if I had played properly&mdash;for being
    in doubt and remembering the adage, I had led a trump, but it
    subsequently turned out that <i>the adversaries had called for
    them</i>. Now I never see an adversaries' call, and but rarely
    those of my partner, unless when made glaringly conspicuous by
    a ten and a two, so I led this wretched card with disastrous
    results.</p>

    <p>However, my partner accepted the situation with unexpected
    suavity, merely remarking pleasantly, as an item of general
    interest, "The only time my partner ever leads a trump is when
    the adversaries call." I smiled inanely&mdash;what else could I
    do? for I was dimly conscious that the stricture might have
    justification in fact. Yes, this was bad; but worse remains
    behind. In the last hand of the next rubber, my partner had
    four trumps; so had I; he had, besides a very long suit; hence
    he extracted the trumps, and we were left with the last two
    between us, mine being the better. I got the lead, of course,
    exactly at the time I did not want it; although everyone else
    knew where the smaller trump was, I did not, so I drew it from
    my partner's hand, and then led him a card of which he had none
    in the suit; this card, as ill-luck would have it, belonged to
    an enormously long suit, of which one of the adversaries had
    entire control. So this gentleman got in and made about six
    tricks in it, finishing up with the two; he therefore made with
    his spades all&mdash;indeed, I rather think more tricks than
    the Colonel ought to have made in his diamonds, each of which,
    now losing cards, he successively banged down with increasing
    anger and turbulence of gesture, as the enormity of my crime
    was borne in upon him. It was the deciding game of a rubber;
    the adversaries' score had stood at one, while we were at two,
    and besides, we had had two by honours; as they made four by
    cards, they went out&mdash;and so did I&mdash;not without an
    <i>obbligato</i> accompaniment on muted strings; unwhispered
    whispers of "confounded blockhead!" "blundering idiot!" "well,
    of all the born fools!" and similar objurgations.</p>

    <p>When I came to think the matter over in cold blood, I could
    see that my proper course would have been to lead the losing
    card before drawing my partner's trump. I merely made a mistake
    (a fatal one I grant) in the order of playing them. That was
    all.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>My friend goes on to make learned remarks about "American
    leads," "the fourth best," and the difficulties of playing a
    knave; lead him at once, <i>I</i> think, on <i>Dogberry's</i>
    principle: and "thank heaven you are rid of a knave."</p>

    <p>The depths of my guilt may be guessed from the fact that
    many of my Mentor's explanations are Hittite to me. People
    talking of laying up a wretched old age by not playing, I
    should be laying it up for other people if I did play much.
    Half-crown points, a partner who knows how to score (those
    counters and candlesticks, or the machines with little bone
    grave-stones that shut up with a snap, bother me), and amiable
    conversation on well-chosen topics while the game goes on, make
    the kind of Whist that I enjoy. We used to play it in Common
    Room in the happy past; it was easier than Loo, which I never
    quite understood. The rigour of the game is the ruin of
    Whist.</p>

        case with the works of genuine genius, "liberal
        applications lie" in his "patter" songs, the enjoyment of
        which need by no means be confined to the Coster and his

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, March 7.</i>&mdash;JOKIM in a
    bad way to-night. People are wanting to know how it has come
    about that TATE's offer of £80,000 for Picture Gallery, with
    £80,000 worth of pictures thrown in to start it, has, after
    long correspondence with CHANCELLOR OF EXCHEQUER, been
    withdrawn. JOKIM rises to explain.</p>

    <p>"What I should really like to do," he whispered to me, in
    confidence, "is to give him one for his <i>tête</i>, as we say
    in cribbage. But suppose I must speak him fair." Did his best
    in that direction though undercurrent of observation in lengthy
    paper he read decidedly set in direction of making TATE out as
    a cantankerous wrong-headed person who, proposing to bestow
    some £160,000 in way of free gift, expected to have his wishes
    consulted in such matter of detail as selection of site for
    Gallery.</p>

    <p>"I venture to hope," said JOKIM, in conclusion, "that the
    door is not finally closed on the establishment of a gallery
    for British Art."</p>

             Dillwyn.
    </div>

    <p>"That's not quite it," said Young Father DILLWYN, with hand
    to ear, listening from corner seat below Gangway he shares with
    that other eminent statesman, the SAGE OF QUEEN ANNE'S GATE.
    "What we complain of is, that you have so managed matters that
    the door hasn't been opened."</p>

    <p>"Ah, well," said JOKIM, wringing his hands, "it's no use my
    trying anything. Remember once seeing in dock of police-court
    at Lyons, a sailor brought up charged with some offence. On his
    arm was tattooed the legend, '<i>Pas de chance</i>.' He told
    long story of honest endeavour, combined with strict honesty
    and tireless industry, ever frustrated by malign accident. In
    short, he was no sooner out of prison than he was sent back
    upon fresh conviction. He had no chance, and one time, in
    enforced retirement from the world, he indelibly inscribed the
    legend on his forearm. <i>Moi aussi, je n'ai pas de chance.</i>
    Ever since I joined this Government things have gone wrong with
    me, whether in Budget Schemes, when acting as Deputy Leader of
    the House, with £1 notes, and now in this affair, where I run
    my head against TATE (sort of <i>tête-à-tête</i>), and, though
    I'm innocent as a lamb, everybody will have it that I've
    muddled things and lost the nation a munificent gift. <i>Pas de
    chance; cher Toby; pas de chance!</i>"</p>

    <p>HANBURY been looking into our Army Service, and behold! it
    is very bad. Condemns it, lock, stock, and barrel. Things no
    better than they were in time of Crimean War. Our Army costs
    more, and could do less than any in the world. Curious to find
    statement like this gravely made in presence of twenty-eight
    Members, all told, including the SPEAKER. Suppose it's true,
    Empire on verge of precipice, into which, on slightest impulse,
    it may totter and disappear. Hon. Members, in the main, care so
    little that they busy themselves
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page144"
       id="page144"></a>[pg 144]</span> writing letters, chatting
       in Lobby, gossipping in Smoke-room; the few present
       admirably succeed in disguising terror that must possess
       them as HANBURY, in solemn voice, utters his
       lamentation.</p>

    <p>"HANBURY," said CRAIG, looking across the House at tall
    figure below Gangway, "reminds me of the old party that rust
    LOCHIEL, and told him his prospects in the next war were at

    <p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Never saw in the flesh procession of
    Russian Convicts starting on their journey to Siberia. Have
    read about it, though; have even seen pictures thereof. The
    most saddening and soul-depressing of these came back to mind
    just now, when PULESTON, PELLY and BURDETT-COUTTS forlornly
    filed forth at command of Chairman of Committees, amid cheers
    of heartless Opposition. If they'd only been a little more
    ragged in appearance, and, above all, if they had been
    connected by leg-chain, illusion would have been complete.
    Members on Front Benches, as they passed them, wearily faring
    forth, could not have resisted natural impulse to feel in their
    waistcoat pocket for a kopec or two to bestow upon the
    unfortunates.</p>

    <p>It was the suddenness of the sentence, the swift falling of
    the blow, that made it so cruelly heavy. Last Friday these
    three Members had supported a vote subsidising East Africa Co.
    in matter of preliminary expenses of railway through their
    territory. Someone had discovered they were pecuniarily
    interested in undertaking. To-day SWIFT MACNEILL raised the
    question of parliamentary law in such cases. Moved Resolution
    that vote of three Members be disallowed.</p>

    <p>Nothing could exceed gentleness of MACNEILL's demeanour.
    Rather in sorrow than in anger he moved in the matter, anxious,
    as all Irish Members are, for purity of Parliamentary practice
    and sanctity of constitutional principles. Almost blubbered in
    BURDETT-COUTTS's waistcoat; embraced PELLY and PULESTON in
    comprehensive smile of amity.</p>

    <p>Encouraged by this attitude, the three Members assumed easy,
    almost jaunty, manner. True, PULESTON admitted he would not
    have done it if he'd thought anyone would have made a row about
    it&mdash;"as the little boy said when he was being spanked for
    putting his fingers in the jam-pot," observed MARJORIBANKS,
    <i>sotto voce</i>. BURDETT-COUTTS almost haughty in his
    defiance of the descendant of the Uncle of JONATHAN SWIFT, Dean
    of St. Patrick's.</p>

    <p>PELLY pensive in manner and enigmatical in allusion; felt it
    particularly hard thus to be placed in the dock, as if he were
    an Irish County Councillor under Prince ARTHUR's new Bill. Only
    last Friday, in debate preceding the very Division now under
    discussion, he had delivered an Address which disclosed
    intimate acquaintance with topographical bearings of rarely
    trodden wilds in Central Africa. Had shown how an Agent of East
    Africa Company, setting forth from So-and-so, had, after
    perilous passage, reached So-on. After a night of broken rest,
    his pillow soothed by the roar of GRANDOLPH's nine lions, he
    had set out again. Crossing the River So-forth he wandered for
    hours, carrying the flag of his country through the limitless
    plains of Etcetera.</p>

    <p>House listened entranced, whilst PELLY hurried them from
    So-on to So-forth.</p>

    <p>"Excellent speech," said the SQUIRE OF MALWOOD, himself not
    unfamiliar with land-surveying; "but the country seems a little
    monotonously named."</p>

    <p>"It's not that," cried PELLY, interrupting; "the fact is, I
    can't pronounce the names in the despatches, and call them
    So-on."</p>

    <p>House delighted with this explanation; PELLY found himself
    at one bound in front rank of Parliamentary orators. This only
    last Friday; to-day called upon to defend himself from charge
    of breaking written law of Parliament. Bad this, but worse to
    come. When PELLY's pensive voice died away, COURTNEY rose from
    Chair and sternly said, "In accordance with practice of the
    House, the three Hon. Members will now withdraw." So they
    strode forth, clothed with innocence. PULESTON first, with
    ghastly smile on his face; BURDETT-COUTTS next, wondering what
    they would think of this in Stratton Street; PELLY bringing up
    the rear, the forlornest file that ever passed between ranks of
    jeering spectators, slowly making their way from So-on to
    So-forth. <i>Business done.</i>&mdash;None.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;"The Leadership isn't all beer and
    skittles, is it?" I said to Prince ARTHUR just now, trying to
    put the best face on a melancholy business.</p>

    <p>"No," he said, shortly, "and it isn't public business at
    all."</p>

    <p>Quite true. What officers in command of sham-fights call
    "the general idea" of the Sitting to-night, was&mdash;questions
    beginning at half-past three; over probably at four; House in
    Committee; take up Army Estimates; peg away at them till
    midnight; then "Who goes home?" Time-table of what actually
    took place slightly, but firmly different. House met at three;
    prayers, which appropriately prefaced HENRY FOWLER's motion to
    permit Salvation Army to go its own way on quiet Sabbaths at
    Eastbourne. Debated this till twenty minutes past six, the
    SOLICITOR-GENERAL heartily joining in the service; then
    questions, seventy or eighty of them, not seven or eight of
    public interest, the rest of character that might be raised on
    dull days in Vestry-hall.</p>

    <p>At half-past seven, time to dress for dinner. Still, Members
    think they'll just wait and see business commenced. "Instead of
    which," as the Judge said, up gets SWIFT MACNEILL, asking
    permission to move Adjournment of House in order to discuss
    famine in India, and shortcomings of Indian Government. SPEAKER
    invites those who support application to rise in their places.
    Gentlemen below the Gangway, with hearts bleeding for famished
    fellow-creatures in far-off Ind (subject reminds them, by the
    way, that dinner is nearly ready), leap to their feet. Twice
    the forty necessary thus forthcoming; leave given, and SWIFT
    MACNEILL proceeds to open his budget. Then strange thing
    happens. The eighty Gentlemen who sprang up to secure hearing
    for MACNEILL, being on their legs, conclude that, as it's so
    near dinner-time, scarcely worth while resuming their seat; so
    they bundle forth, MACNEILL, somewhat ungratefully (for they
    had secured his opportunity) urging them to "be off, if they
    didn't want to hear about the sufferings of their
    fellow-creatures."</p>

    <p>At ten o'clock MACNEILL episode closed. Prince ARTHUR moved,
    with intent to expedite business, a Resolution taking Report of
    Supply after midnight. Talked on this till twenty minutes to
    twelve. Business reached at last, but since Debate closes at
    midnight, no time to do anything. Committee of Supply
    accordingly postponed, and Members begin chatting about Gresham
    College, admitting in course of conversation that there is
    nothing to talk about, since Government have adopted suggestion
    of objectors to scheme.</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;None.</p>

    <p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;MACNEILL the Avenger to the front
    again, with his Motion about the Siberian Exiles. "JEMMY"
    LOWTHER, in most judicial manner, supports Motion, that votes
    of PELLY, PULESTON and BURDETT-COUTTS on Mombasa Affair shall
    be struck out. Prince ARTHUR argues on other side; Mr. G.
    throws weight of his authority into scale against the Exiles;
    JOKIM feebly attempts to reply. On Division, in full House,
    Government defeated by five votes. MACNEILL's smile, as he
    announced the figures, simply enormous. "At first I thought it
    was an earthquake," said STANHOPE, shuddering. Nerves shattered
    by second defeat of Government in the week. <i>Business
    done.</i>&mdash;Looks as if the Government's was&mdash;very
    nearly.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
